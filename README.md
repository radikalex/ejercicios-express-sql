# Exercises using Express.js with MySQL ðŸ””


This project simulates a simple backend of a site that stores Users, Orders, Products and Categories.
The main idea of the project is practice creating different endpoints with different requests such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 
In the project, custom middlewares are used for different validations and an MVC architecture pattern is used to improve the structure of the project and separate the logic.



## Previous requirements
1. You need to have mysql installed to be able to use it as localhost.
2. You need also to have installed node.
3. You should use your own database, so go to config folder and create a file named database.js using database_example.js as template

### Install ðŸ”§

Start with cloning the code from this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/radikalex/ejercicios-express-sql
```

Use npm to install the necessary modules:

```
npm install
```

Once this is done we can open the server with:
```
npm start
```
### Recommendations
1. Create the tables in this order: Categories, Products, Users, Orders and Orders_Products.
2. You can see some example of requests in [requestsExercises.txt](https://github.com/radikalex/ejercicios-express-sql/blob/main/requestsExercises.txt)
